Notes and Additional Features
***Tasskman.com domain is available! dont buy until divorced***


- *** UI Changes ***
 ~~Change in top left~~ 
    ~~ remove grid view~~   
    ~~ move search bar and add quick task~~     
    ~~ move filter and sort~~
    ~~ add mark complete button~~
    ~~ make currently timing element larger to be more visible and almost annoying~~
 

- *** Issues ***
 ~~est time is off when saving. went from 30 min to 5 hours to 4166h 40 min~~
 ~~invalid status not letting me start task~~

- *** Changes ***
 Cards more compact
 ***Please change the prd to remove timing subtasks.  this might be a bit too granular as if there are significant sub tasks that need to be timed, they should be their own task in a project instead.  we will need to add a project view to handle this during development later on.

- ***Ideas for additional features:***
 List feature for shopping etc
 quick keys to map tasks
 calendar integration
 user defined categories and subcategories
  ask about calendar integration
 ask about list option
 bucket view option
 persistant day achievements


- ***2025.04.01 9.30 Phase 1&2 Progress and Next Steps***

    - Based on my review of the PRD and our progress so far, here's an assessment of where we stand and what we should consider before moving to the next phase:

        Progress Assessment
        You've made excellent progress through Phase 2 (Core Task Management) with most items checked off:

        ✅ Task filtering by status, priority, etc.
        ✅ Task sorting options
        ✅ Quick status updates without full edit
        ✅ Task categories/contexts
        ✅ Task search functionality
        ✅ List and grid view toggle (though temporarily removed to focus on list view)
    ✅ Settings page implementation (just completed)

    - ~~ What's Next Before Moving On~~
        x Database Schema Consistency
        xEnsure the task creation and editing forms fully align with your Supabase schema
    Double-check that all required fields are properly validated

    - ~~ x Potential Refactoring Opportunities~~
        xThe task card layout implementation could benefit from extracting reusable components for consistency
        xConsider consolidating duplicate logic between task creation and editing

    - ~~x Testing for Phase 2 Completeness~~
    Verify all basic CRUD operations work end-to-end
    Test task filtering and sorting to ensure they work as expected
    Validate that the settings persist correctly

    - ~~Preparation for Phase 3 (Timer v1)~~
    According to your phased plan, Timer v1 is next, focusing on:
    Single task time tracking
    Session logging
    Review the Timer component you already have to prepare for enhancements

    - Recommendations Before Moving On
    ~~  X Documentation Update~~    
    ~~    X Document the current state of the application~~
    ~~    X Update any design documents or component diagrams~~
Technical Debt Assessment
     ~~Address any quick fixes or workarounds that should be properly implemented~~
     ~~Look for components that may need refactoring before adding more features~~
Design Review
     ~~Ensure UI consistency across all implemented components~~
    ~~Verify the mobile responsiveness of the new settings page~~

***Refactoring Opportunities***
- Based on our work so far and the refactoring plan in your notes, there are several additional refactoring opportunities to further enhance the scalability, modularity, and future-proofing of TaskMan:

1. UI Component Layer Improvements
Component Library Abstraction:
Create a dedicated UI component library with standardized styling and behavior
Implement atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms) for better component composition
Add documentation with Storybook to enable easier collaboration and reuse
Form Handling Abstraction:
Create a form management abstraction using a library like React Hook Form
Implement a consistent validation pattern using Zod or Yup
Decouple form rendering from validation logic for better testability
2. State Management Enhancements
Redux/Zustand Integration:
Consider moving from React Context to a more robust state management solution
Create specialized slices/stores for different domain concepts (tasks, time sessions, settings)
Implement middleware for side effects handling like logging, analytics, and error reporting
Feature Flags System:
Implement a feature flag system to enable/disable features at runtime
Support gradual rollouts and A/B testing of new functionality
Add configuration system for environment-specific settings
3. Data Layer Optimizations
Query Caching Strategy:
Implement more sophisticated caching using React Query or SWR
Add cache invalidation strategies based on mutation operations
Improve response time with optimistic updates and background refetching
Data Transformation Layer:
Create data transformation utilities to convert between API and UI representations
Implement consistent serialization/deserialization patterns
Support schema versioning to handle API changes gracefully
4. Performance and Optimization
Code Splitting and Lazy Loading:
Implement route-based code splitting to reduce initial bundle size
Add lazy loading for heavy components that aren't immediately needed
Implement virtualized lists for handling large data sets
Performance Monitoring:
Add performance metrics collection for key UI operations
Implement React Profiler integration to identify rendering bottlenecks
Create performance budgets and automated monitoring
5. Testing Infrastructure
Comprehensive Testing Strategy:
Implement unit tests for business logic using Jest or Vitest
Add component testing with Testing Library or Cypress Component Testing
Create end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
Mocking Infrastructure:
Create a robust mocking system for services and API calls
Implement a consistent test data generation strategy
Add test coverage reporting and quality gates
6. Project Structure Improvements
Domain-Driven File Organization:
Reorganize the codebase by domain features rather than technical role
Co-locate related components, services, and tests
Create clear boundaries between application domains
Module Federation:
For larger teams, consider splitting the application into micro-frontends
Implement module federation to allow independent development and deployment
Define clear contracts between application modules
7. Developer Experience Enhancements
Documentation System:
Implement automated API documentation for services and components
Create architectural decision records (ADRs) for key technical decisions
Add developer guides for common tasks and patterns
Tooling Improvements:
Enhance linting and formatting rules for consistency
Add pre-commit hooks for quality checks
Implement automated code quality metrics
Each of these areas would significantly contribute to the application's scalability, making it more maintainable as the application grows in features and complexity
