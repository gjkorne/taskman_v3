- ***2025.04.01 9.30 Phase 1&2 Progress and Next Steps***

    - Based on my review of the PRD and our progress so far, here's an assessment of where we stand and what we should consider before moving to the next phase:

        Progress Assessment
        You've made excellent progress through Phase 2 (Core Task Management) with most items checked off:

        ✅ Task filtering by status, priority, etc.
        ✅ Task sorting options
        ✅ Quick status updates without full edit
        ✅ Task categories/contexts
        ✅ Task search functionality
        ✅ List and grid view toggle (though temporarily removed to focus on list view)
    ✅ Settings page implementation (just completed)

    - ~~ What's Next Before Moving On~~
        x Database Schema Consistency
        xEnsure the task creation and editing forms fully align with your Supabase schema
    Double-check that all required fields are properly validated

    - ~~ x Potential Refactoring Opportunities~~
        xThe task card layout implementation could benefit from extracting reusable components for consistency
        xConsider consolidating duplicate logic between task creation and editing

    - ~~x Testing for Phase 2 Completeness~~
    Verify all basic CRUD operations work end-to-end
    Test task filtering and sorting to ensure they work as expected
    Validate that the settings persist correctly

    - ~~Preparation for Phase 3 (Timer v1)~~
    According to your phased plan, Timer v1 is next, focusing on:
    Single task time tracking
    Session logging
    Review the Timer component you already have to prepare for enhancements

    - Recommendations Before Moving On
    ~~  X Documentation Update~~    
    ~~    X Document the current state of the application~~
    ~~    X Update any design documents or component diagrams~~
Technical Debt Assessment
     ~~Address any quick fixes or workarounds that should be properly implemented~~
     ~~Look for components that may need refactoring before adding more features~~
Design Review
     ~~Ensure UI consistency across all implemented components~~
    ~~Verify the mobile responsiveness of the new settings page~~

Once you've addressed these points, you'll be well-positioned to move into Phase 3 with a solid foundation. Would you like me to help you address any of these specific areas before proceeding to the Timer v1 implementation?
