- ***2025.04.01 9.30 Phase 1&2 Progress and Next Steps***

Based on my review of the PRD and our progress so far, here's an assessment of where we stand and what we should consider before moving to the next phase:

Progress Assessment
You've made excellent progress through Phase 2 (Core Task Management) with most items checked off:

✅ Task filtering by status, priority, etc.
✅ Task sorting options
✅ Quick status updates without full edit
✅ Task categories/contexts
✅ Task search functionality
✅ List and grid view toggle (though temporarily removed to focus on list view)
✅ Settings page implementation (just completed)

What's Next Before Moving On
- Database Schema Consistency
    Ensure the task creation and editing forms fully align with your Supabase schema
Double-check that all required fields are properly validated

- Potential Refactoring Opportunities
    The task card layout implementation could benefit from extracting reusable components for consistency
    Consider consolidating duplicate logic between task creation and editing

- Testing for Phase 2 Completeness
Verify all basic CRUD operations work end-to-end
Test task filtering and sorting to ensure they work as expected
Validate that the settings persist correctly

- Preparation for Phase 3 (Timer v1)
According to your phased plan, Timer v1 is next, focusing on:
Single task time tracking
Session logging
Review the Timer component you already have to prepare for enhancements

- Recommendations Before Moving On
Documentation Update
    Document the current state of the application
    Update any design documents or component diagrams
Technical Debt Assessment
    Address any quick fixes or workarounds that should be properly implemented
    Look for components that may need refactoring before adding more features
Design Review
    Ensure UI consistency across all implemented components
Verify the mobile responsiveness of the new settings page

Once you've addressed these points, you'll be well-positioned to move into Phase 3 with a solid foundation. Would you like me to help you address any of these specific areas before proceeding to the Timer v1 implementation?
