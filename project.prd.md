________________________________________
2. Core Features
J. Projects and Grouped Task Management
Project Support (MVP)
‚Ä¢	Introduce a projects table as a first-class object in the system
‚Ä¢	Each project includes:
‚Ä¢	id: uuid
‚Ä¢	user_id: uuid
‚Ä¢	name: text
‚Ä¢	description: text
‚Ä¢	created_at: timestamptz
‚Ä¢	due_date: date
‚Ä¢	archived: boolean
‚Ä¢	Tasks may belong to a project via a new project_id field in the tasks table
‚Ä¢	Project-level features:
o	Group tasks by project in views
o	Aggregate task progress and time spent per project
o	Support for project-specific filters, dashboards, and summaries
o	Allow tagging of goals, notes, or milestones at the project level
‚Ä¢	Future Enhancements:
o	Project progress tracking and percent complete
o	Project timeline views (calendar or Gantt)
o	Shared or team-owned projects with role-based access
A. Task Creation & Storage
Task Lifecycle Glossary
Term	Meaning
status	'active', 'completed', 'archived' ‚Äì represents lifecycle state
activity_state	'idle', 'in_progress', 'paused' ‚Äì describes real-time engagement
is_evergreen	Persistent task that spawns repeated instances
recurring_type	Enum for automatic recurrence intervals
due_date	Soft/hard deadline, manually adjustable
Tagging Support
‚Ä¢	Users can add custom tags to each task for flexible grouping and filtering
‚Ä¢	Tags are stored in a new custom_tags: text[] field in the tasks table
‚Ä¢	Tags can be used for:
o	Search and filtering (e.g., "#deepwork", "#admin")
o	Visual markers in task cards
o	Organizational groupings without changing category or priority
‚Ä¢	The app will surface frequently used tags as suggestions when adding/editing tasks
‚Ä¢	Future enhancements:
o	Tag analytics in dashboard views
o	Color coding or pinning tags for quick access
Notes and File Attachments
‚Ä¢	Each task supports longform notes (markdown-style formatting allowed)
‚Ä¢	Tasks may include one or more file attachments via attachment_urls field
‚Ä¢	Attachments stored as public/private URLs (via Supabase Storage or external links)
‚Ä¢	Notes and attachments are shown in task detail views and editable from creation/edit form
‚Ä¢	Files may include:
o	Screenshots
o	Reference documents
o	External resource links
‚Ä¢	Future: support drag-and-drop upload and inline file previews
Due Date Support
‚Ä¢	Tasks may optionally include a due_date field to represent a soft or hard deadline
‚Ä¢	If a task has a due_date, the has_deadline flag is set to true
‚Ä¢	due_date is independent of recurring_type and may vary per instance
‚Ä¢	Useful for:
o	Filtering overdue tasks
o	Planning day/week views
o	Future: generating reminders or urgency prioritization
‚Ä¢	Due dates are cloned on recurring tasks but may be adjusted manually per instance
Evergreen Tasks and Templates
Task Cloning Support
‚Ä¢	Any task (not just evergreen) can be cloned from the task menu
‚Ä¢	Cloned task behavior:
o	A new task is created with a new UUID
o	All metadata fields are copied (title, description, tags, estimated time, etc.)
o	Time logs are not copied
o	A new field cloned_from_task_id stores the reference to the original task
‚Ä¢	Cloning is available from the UI ("Clone task" action)
‚Ä¢	Future enhancements:
o	Grouping or filtering by source task
o	View clone lineage or clone count
‚Ä¢	Evergreen tasks (is_evergreen: true) serve a dual role:
o	Persistent tasks used for routines, habits, or time tracking (e.g., ‚ÄúDaily Journal‚Äù)
o	Reusable templates to spawn new instances with pre-filled metadata
‚Ä¢	When used as a template:
o	The user can choose 'Use as Template' in the UI
o	A new task is created with a unique UUID and a reference to the original evergreen task in template_task_id
o	The new task inherits metadata such as title, description, tags, category, subtasks, etc.
‚Ä¢	Evergreen tasks are not included in the default task view
‚Ä¢	This merged model avoids duplication while maintaining clarity
‚Ä¢	Future: If team mode or shared template libraries become prominent, consider extracting templates into a separate table
‚Ä¢	Evergreen tasks (is_evergreen: true) serve both as:
o	Persistent, reusable tasks for routines, habits, and tracking
o	Template-like structures for recurring or patterned task creation
‚Ä¢	When an evergreen task is used to spawn a new instance:
o	A new task is created (with its own UUID)
o	It stores a reference to the original template in template_task_id
‚Ä¢	Evergreen tasks are not shown in the main active task views by default
‚Ä¢	Future enhancement: option to convert any task into a reusable template (or separate templates table if team/collaboration support is needed)
‚Ä¢	Manual task form with inputs for:
o	Title
o	Description
o	Category (1-4)
o	Subcategory (1-6)
o	Priority (1-3)
o	Estimated Time (1-5)
o	Recurring Type (1-5)
o	Exclusive Flag (boolean)
o	Evergreen Flag (boolean)
o	Location Dependency (L1-L3 as tags or enum)
o	Energy Requirement (E1-E3 as tags or enum)
o	Context Switching Cost (C1-C3 as tags or enum)
o	Additional Flags: is_blocked, is_waiting, is_shared, is_milestone, has_deadline
‚Ä¢	Optional parent task selection for subtasks
‚Ä¢	Store in Supabase using uuid as PK; store metadata in structured columns
B. Task Display & Management
Manual Sorting Outside "Next Up"
‚Ä¢	Manual drag-and-drop reordering is supported only within the "Next Up" zone (max 3 tasks)
‚Ä¢	All other tasks follow dynamic sort logic (priority, created date, etc.)
‚Ä¢	This avoids complexity with maintaining separate manual sort orders across filtered views
‚Ä¢	Users can still use filters + sorting controls to shape their view
‚Ä¢	Future enhancement: custom groupings or buckets with drag-and-drop sorting across groups
Filtering Logic
‚Ä¢	Users can filter tasks using multi-select or toggle-based controls:
o	Status: Active, Completed, Archived
o	Category/Subcategory
o	Priority (P1‚ÄìP3)
o	Energy Level (E1‚ÄìE3)
o	Location Tag (L1‚ÄìL3)
o	Feature flags (Evergreen, Waiting, Shared, etc.)
o	Include/Exclude: Evergreen Tasks, Recurring Tasks
o	Activity State: In Progress, Paused, Idle
‚Ä¢	Filtering supports compound logic (e.g., show all active + high energy + non-evergreen tasks)
Sorting Logic
‚Ä¢	User can sort task lists by:
o	Manual drag order (manual_sort_order for "Next Up" zone)
o	Created date (asc/desc)
o	Estimated time
o	Priority level (P1‚ÄìP3)
o	Energy requirement
o	Context cost
‚Ä¢	Sorting logic is separate from filtering and does not override visual priority in drag-based zones
Display & Interaction
‚Ä¢	Persistent view of the currently active task card at the top or pinned area of the interface, showing title and elapsed time since start
‚Ä¢	Ability to "star" or prioritize tasks by dragging and dropping them into a dedicated "Next Up" zone (max 3 tasks)
‚Ä¢	Drag-and-drop reordering of task cards to manually adjust priority or workflow order (visual notecard/post-it metaphor)
‚Ä¢	Task drag order is treated as execution priority, independent of the priority field
‚Ä¢	priority (P1‚ÄìP3) is retained for metadata filtering and suggestion purposes
‚Ä¢	A manual_sort_order field will be stored for drag-and-drop sorting
‚Ä¢	Task list view supports:
o	Filtering by Status, Category, Priority, Location, Energy, Feature flags
o	Nested display for subtasks
o	Ability to edit/update/delete tasks
o	Option to include or exclude Evergreen and Recurring tasks
‚Ä¢	Start/Stop timer for tasks
‚Ä¢	One exclusive task timer allowed at a time
‚Ä¢	Multiple concurrent non-exclusive timers allowed
‚Ä¢	Track time logs with:
o	Task UUID
o	Start time
o	End time
o	Duration (computed)
o	Notes
o	Exclusive flag
D. Task Sessions and Aggregation
üõ°Ô∏è Subtask depth is restricted to one level. Validation prevents subtasks from being created under other subtasks. üß© Subtasks marked repeat_with_parent: false will not be cloned with recurring parent tasks (future setting).
Project Relationship Behavior
‚Ä¢	Projects display all associated tasks automatically
‚Ä¢	Filters can be scoped to individual projects from sidebar or dashboard view
üí° Clarity Suggestion: Consider adding a last_session_ended_at field (denormalized) on the task table to improve filtering by "recently worked on." üí° UX Reminder: Add a visual badge or tag for tasks that include both parent-level and subtask-level time logs to indicate mixed session types.
Time Log Editing Permissions
‚Ä¢	Users may edit or delete any time log at any time (manual or automatic)
‚Ä¢	Supports self-correction for tracking errors or retroactive logging
‚Ä¢	Editing is done through the task detail view:
o	Edit start/end times, duration, or notes
o	Log changes are validated to prevent overlap or invalid timestamps
‚Ä¢	Deleted logs are soft-deleted and remain queryable in the event_logs table
‚Ä¢	Manual logs are tagged for audit clarity, and future enhancements may include a change history for edited logs
‚Ä¢	No time-based restrictions (e.g., 24-hour window) or lifecycle locking (e.g., only editable while task is active)
‚Ä¢	Designed for solo self-reporting use where accuracy and flexibility are prioritized
Time Log Viewer Behavior
‚Ä¢	By default, each task will display only the total time spent (e.g., "Total time: 2h 45m")
‚Ä¢	Users may click a ‚ÄúView Sessions‚Äù toggle or expand icon to view a detailed list of time logs:
o	Each session displays: start_time, end_time, duration, and any user-entered notes
o	Manual entries are visually tagged (e.g., with a üìù icon)
o	Logs are sorted by most recent first
‚Ä¢	This expandable interface ensures a clean and uncluttered task view while preserving access to log-level detail for auditing or reflection
‚Ä¢	Future enhancement: collapsed summary like "5 sessions ‚Ä¢ 3 manual ‚Ä¢ 2:45 total"
Subtask Completion Prompt
‚Ä¢	When all subtasks under a parent task are marked as 'completed', the system prompts the user with the option:
o	‚ÄúAll subtasks completed. Would you like to mark the parent task as complete?‚Äù
‚Ä¢	This preserves manual control while streamlining task closure
‚Ä¢	The prompt is shown only once per parent task unless new subtasks are added or existing ones are re-opened
‚Ä¢	The user can manually mark the parent task as complete at any time
‚Ä¢	This behavior ensures better clarity in reports and task hygiene without enforcing automatic status changes
Search and Query Behavior
‚Ä¢	Users can perform keyword searches across tasks using a basic full-text search bar
‚Ä¢	Search matches are case-insensitive and check the following fields:
o	title
o	description
o	custom_tags
o	notes
‚Ä¢	Search queries are combined with active filters (e.g., category, priority, energy)
‚Ä¢	Search field is optional and non-destructive (i.e., clearing the search resets view)
‚Ä¢	Future Enhancements:
o	Add structured query parsing (e.g., tag:deepwork priority:P1)
o	Integrate NLP to convert natural language input into structured filters (e.g., "tasks I can do at home that need low energy")
o	Support tsvector search index in Supabase for stemming/fuzzy matching
Multi-User Assignment and Shared Task Ownership
Task Visibility Levels
‚Ä¢	Each task includes a visibility field to control access:
o	'private': visible only to the creator
o	'shared': visible to assigned users via task_assignments
o	'public': visible to all users in a shared workspace (future enhancement)
‚Ä¢	Default behavior:
o	New tasks are 'private' unless explicitly shared or assigned
o	When a task is assigned to other users, visibility automatically becomes 'shared'
‚Ä¢	UI behavior:
o	Visibility indicator shown on task detail and list views
o	Users can set or update visibility when editing tasks
‚Ä¢	Future enhancements:
o	Enforcement of view/edit permissions based on role and visibility
o	Filters for "my private tasks" vs. "shared with me" vs. "team-wide"
‚Ä¢	Tasks can be assigned to one or more users through a dedicated task_assignments table
‚Ä¢	Each assignment includes:
o	task_id: ID of the shared task
o	user_id: ID of the user assigned to it
o	role: optional assignment role (e.g., owner, editor, viewer, assignee)
‚Ä¢	The task table retains:
o	user_id: original creator of the task
o	is_shared: flag to indicate whether the task is shared with others
‚Ä¢	Roles are soft-defined at this stage and may be used for UI-level filtering and optional permission control in future phases
‚Ä¢	Shared task behaviors:
o	Multiple users can appear in filter/search as assigned participants
o	Assignees may receive reminders or suggestions based on assignment
o	Shared tasks may appear in shared views, dashboards, or reports
‚Ä¢	Future enhancements:
o	Visibility control (visibility: private, shared, public)
o	Role enforcement (edit/view restrictions)
o	Team dashboards or ownership transfers
Task Linking and Reference Relationships
‚Ä¢	Tasks may optionally be linked to other tasks to express soft relationships beyond subtasks and templates
‚Ä¢	A separate task_links table enables flexible linking and future relationship types
‚Ä¢	Each link consists of:
o	from_task_id: the task initiating the reference
o	to_task_id: the task being referenced
o	link_type: defines the nature of the link (e.g., related, follows, duplicate, informs, dependent)
‚Ä¢	Initial behavior:
o	Links are for reference and organization only; no logic or gating behavior is enforced
o	Related tasks may be shown in task detail views
‚Ä¢	Future enhancements may include:
o	Enforced gating (e.g., prevent task start unless dependency is complete)
o	Visual graph view of linked tasks
o	Filtering by tasks linked to a specific project or theme
Reminder and Notification System
‚Ä¢	Reminders help surface important or time-sensitive tasks proactively
‚Ä¢	Types of reminders:
o	Due Date Reminder: triggered from due_date, calculated using a user-defined lead time (e.g., same day, 1 day before)
o	Waiting Task Reminder: recurring reminder after a user-defined interval for is_waiting tasks (e.g., every 3 days)
o	Blocked Task Reminder: reminder triggered when a blocker task is resolved (future enhancement)
o	Next Up Nudges: optional reminder if no task has been started in X minutes while a "Next Up" task is queued
‚Ä¢	Reminders may use a remind_at timestamp field in the tasks table for system scheduling
‚Ä¢	All reminders are local-only for MVP (e.g., surface in Bolt UI or app banner)
‚Ä¢	Future Enhancements:
o	Add notification options (push/email)
o	Add customizable default reminder rules in settings
Recurring Task Logic
‚Ä¢	Tasks may be flagged with a recurring_type value to indicate recurrence pattern:
o	R1: Daily
o	R2: Weekly
o	R3: Monthly
o	R4: Quarterly
o	R5: Annually
o	R6: User-defined (custom number of days between repetitions)
‚Ä¢	When a recurring task is completed:
o	A new task instance is automatically generated at the appropriate interval (e.g., next day for R1)
o	The new instance:
ÔÇß	Gets a fresh UUID
ÔÇß	Inherits all relevant metadata (e.g., title, description, category, estimated_time, priority, subtasks)
ÔÇß	Stores a reference to the original task in template_task_id
o	Subtasks are also cloned by default
ÔÇß	Each subtask gets a new UUID
ÔÇß	Status is reset to default (active, idle)
ÔÇß	Time logs and activity state are not carried over
ÔÇß	Estimated time, due date, and metadata are retained
‚Ä¢	Recurring tasks are treated independently in analytics and history (each instance maintains its own time logs)
‚Ä¢	Users may adjust the due date of the cloned instance independently from the recurrence pattern
‚Ä¢	Future setting may allow custom rule builder for recurrence
‚Ä¢	Future enhancement: add a flag per subtask for selective cloning (e.g., repeat_with_parent: false)
‚Ä¢	Tasks may be flagged with a recurring_type value to indicate recurrence pattern:
o	R1: Daily
o	R2: Weekly
o	R3: Monthly
o	R4: Quarterly
o	R5: Annually
o	R6: User-defined (custom number of days between repetitions)
‚Ä¢	When a recurring task is completed:
o	A new task instance is automatically generated at the appropriate interval (e.g., next day for R1)
o	The new instance:
ÔÇß	Gets a fresh UUID
ÔÇß	Inherits all relevant metadata (e.g., title, description, category, estimated_time, priority, subtasks)
ÔÇß	Stores a reference to the original task in template_task_id
o	Subtasks are also cloned unless otherwise specified
‚Ä¢	Recurring tasks are treated independently in analytics and history (each instance maintains its own time logs)
‚Ä¢	Users may adjust the due date of the cloned instance independently from the recurrence pattern
‚Ä¢	Future setting may allow custom rule builder for recurrence
Blocked vs. Waiting Task Flags
‚Ä¢	Blocked Tasks (is_blocked: true):
o	Indicates the task cannot currently proceed due to an unmet prerequisite (e.g., waiting on another internal task or deliverable)
o	UI behavior:
ÔÇß	Card appears visually dimmed or marked as blocked
ÔÇß	Timer start is disabled unless manually overridden
ÔÇß	User can remove the blocked flag when the task becomes unblocked
‚Ä¢	Waiting Tasks (is_waiting: true):
o	Indicates the task is waiting on someone or something external, but could resume once unblocked
o	Common for follow-ups, approvals, or external inputs (e.g., "waiting on reply from client")
o	UI behavior:
ÔÇß	Card displays an icon or indicator for 'waiting'
ÔÇß	Remains accessible and can still be started if desired
‚Ä¢	Both flags are filterable and visible in task metadata
‚Ä¢	Future Enhancements:
o	Add optional blocked_by_task_id field for structured dependencies
o	Add waiting_on text field (e.g., "Waiting on Jane")
o	Notification/reminder system for long-standing blocked or waiting tasks
Interruption Logging & Context Switching
‚Ä¢	Interruption events are logged automatically when a user switches away from an in-progress task
‚Ä¢	Each interruption log includes:
o	from_task_id: task being interrupted
o	to_task_id: task switched to (nullable if none)
o	timestamp: when the interruption occurred
o	Optional tag or reason (to be supported in future enhancement)
‚Ä¢	Interruption logs are used to analyze context switching patterns and productivity losses
‚Ä¢	No prompts shown to the user initially (low-friction, passive collection)
‚Ä¢	Future UI features:
o	Manual "Log Interruption" button with tagging options (e.g., "Phone call", "Slack message")
o	Context switch heatmaps and reports in analytics
Archival Lifecycle and Visibility
‚Ä¢	Completed tasks can be archived to reduce clutter
‚Ä¢	Archived tasks are hidden from main views by default but remain fully queryable for:
o	Time logs
o	Historical summaries
o	Daily, weekly, or custom reports
‚Ä¢	Archiving does not affect time_logs or reporting queries unless explicitly filtered
‚Ä¢	Archival can be manual or automatic:
o	Default: auto-archive tasks X days after completion (default: 30)
o	User-configurable in settings via archived_after_days
o	Users can manually archive or restore tasks
‚Ä¢	Archived tasks are preserved with full metadata, UID, and time log links
‚Ä¢	Each task includes an estimated_time_minutes field to capture how long the user believes the task will take (in minutes or hours)
‚Ä¢	If a task has subtasks, the parent‚Äôs estimated time is automatically calculated as the sum of its subtasks‚Äô estimated times
‚Ä¢	Estimated time is used for filtering, sorting, planning views, and (eventually) AI suggestions
‚Ä¢	Future enhancement: allow system or LLM to predict estimated_time_minutes based on task metadata, historical patterns, or similar tasks
‚Ä¢	Tasks support one level of subtasks only
‚Ä¢	Each subtask has its own time logs
‚Ä¢	Parent tasks may also have their own direct time logs
‚Ä¢	Time aggregation behavior:
o	Parent task total time = sum of its own time logs + all of its subtasks' time logs
o	Subtasks do not aggregate recursively beyond one level
o	Time from both completed and active subtasks is included in the parent's total
‚Ä¢	Future enhancement (optional): allow configuration to only roll up time from completed subtasks
‚Ä¢	Tasks have two separate state indicators:
o	status: lifecycle state of the task ‚Äî 'active', 'completed', 'archived'
o	activity_state: current engagement ‚Äî 'idle', 'in_progress', 'paused'
‚Ä¢	Default for new tasks:
o	status: 'active'
o	activity_state: 'idle'
‚Ä¢	Mark tasks as "in progress" when a user starts them
‚Ä¢	Automatically change to "paused" or "incomplete" if the session ends without completion
‚Ä¢	Record unique work sessions in the time_logs table
‚Ä¢	Aggregate session data per task:
o	Total time spent
o	List of individual sessions with timestamps and durations
‚Ä¢	For subtasks:
o	Aggregate session data per subtask
o	Sum all subtask times under the parent task for holistic reporting
Dual Time Aggregation Model (Raw vs. Net)
‚Ä¢	Raw Total: Sum of all duration values across time logs (e.g., 6 hrs childcare + 2 hrs taxes = 8 hrs)
‚Ä¢	Net Time: Deduplicated actual time worked (e.g., if childcare overlapped with taxes, report only 6 hrs total)
‚Ä¢	Use exclusive flag to help identify overlapping blocks
‚Ä¢	Present both values in reports:
o	Task-level views show Raw Total
o	Daily/weekly dashboards can include Net Time to reflect actual unique time spent
Example:
‚Ä¢	Childcare: 1‚Äì7 PM (6 hrs, non-exclusive)
‚Ä¢	Taxes: 3‚Äì5 PM (2 hrs, exclusive)
‚Ä¢	Childcare task will show 6 hrs total
‚Ä¢	Taxes will show 2 hrs total
‚Ä¢	Net time for the day: 6 hrs (3‚Äì5 PM double-counting normalized)
‚Ä¢	Tasks have two separate state indicators:
o	status: lifecycle state of the task ‚Äî 'active', 'completed', 'archived'
o	activity_state: current engagement ‚Äî 'idle', 'in_progress', 'paused'
‚Ä¢	Default for new tasks:
o	status: 'active'
o	activity_state: 'idle'
‚Ä¢	Mark tasks as "in progress" when a user starts them
‚Ä¢	Automatically change to "paused" or "incomplete" if the session ends without completion
‚Ä¢	Record unique work sessions in the time_logs table
‚Ä¢	Aggregate session data per task:
o	Total time spent
o	List of individual sessions with timestamps and durations
‚Ä¢	For subtasks:
o	Aggregate session data per subtask
o	Sum all subtask times under the parent task for holistic reporting
‚Ä¢	User interface updates:
o	Display total time next to each task in list view
o	Expandable section to view detailed session breakdown per task or subtask
E. UID Simplification
‚Ä¢	Use uuid for identity and joins
‚Ä¢	Avoid encoding metadata in UID strings
F. JSONB Flexibility
‚Ä¢	Include features_json column in tasks to:
o	Store tags, NLP-extracted data, historical UID versions
o	Enable schema-free expansion of features
G. Future NLP Integration
Re-parse Option
‚Ä¢	Users may select "Re-parse with LLM" if a parsed task is missing expected metadata
‚Ä¢	The original input and NLP result are preserved in features_json
‚Ä¢	Re-parses are logged as nlp_parse_retry in event_logs
Event Logging for NLP and UX Feedback
‚Ä¢	The app logs structured events related to NLP parsing and UI interaction to event_logs
‚Ä¢	Logged events may include:
o	nlp_parse_attempt
o	nlp_parse_success
o	nlp_parse_failed
o	nlp_corrected (with fields that were manually changed)
o	task_created, filter_applied, timer_started, etc.
‚Ä¢	Each log captures:
o	user_id
o	event_type
o	task_id (if applicable)
o	timestamp
o	metadata field for structured payloads
‚Ä¢	This enables tracking of:
o	NLP performance across LLMs
o	User interaction patterns (e.g., top filters used)
o	Behavior-based feature design decisions
LLM Integration Strategy
‚Ä¢	Task NLP parsing will be handled by a pluggable LLM model (default: OpenAI GPT-4-Turbo)
‚Ä¢	Greg may configure or experiment with alternate models (e.g., Claude, Gemini, Mistral)
‚Ä¢	API integration will be modular to allow model switching and testing
‚Ä¢	Prompt structure will map user input into structured task metadata
‚Ä¢	NLP response must include:
o	title
o	category / subcategory
o	optional: priority, time estimate, tags, recurrence, notes, and flags
‚Ä¢	NLP parsing behavior:
o	Input is sent synchronously during task creation
o	Output pre-fills task_form for review
o	Original input and parsed metadata stored in features_json
‚Ä¢	Fallbacks:
o	If NLP fails, user receives default blank task form
o	Retry or manual entry supported
‚Ä¢	Future Enhancements:
o	Multiple LLM performance comparison logs
o	NLP model-specific analytics for accuracy
o	Prompt tuning system to iterate based on field-by-field corrections
NLP Feedback and Correction Loop
‚Ä¢	NLP-generated tasks populate the task_form automatically with parsed metadata
‚Ä¢	Users must confirm or edit before submission (no automatic saves)
‚Ä¢	Parsed metadata includes:
o	Title, description, category, priority, etc.
o	Flags like energy level, exclusive, deadline, etc.
‚Ä¢	Original input text and NLP-parsed result are stored in features_json
‚Ä¢	Future enhancement:
o	Store NLP corrections (e.g., "original priority was P1, user changed to P2")
o	Use this for prompt tuning, pattern analysis, and improving NLP accuracy
o	Allow user to flag bad parses or request a re-parse
H. UID Generator (Display/Training Use Only)
‚Ä¢	While UUIDs are used as primary identifiers, a human-readable UID generator may still be retained for:
o	Future NLP pattern matching and training references
o	Display in logs, exports, or user summaries (e.g., 2.1.2403-001:X1P1)
o	Legacy debugging or audit trails
o	Evergreen task version tracking or instance grouping
‚Ä¢	If used, this display_uid will:
o	Be stored in a non-critical column (e.g., display_uid or inside features_json)
o	Be generated from structured metadata
o	Never be relied on for uniqueness, logic, or foreign key relations
o	Optionally be regenerated from source metadata
‚Ä¢	NLP interface to parse task text into structured form
‚Ä¢	Populate task_form automatically with parsed metadata
‚Ä¢	Seamlessly integrate with existing task creation flow

time_logs Table
üí° Note: Consider adding created_by and modified_by fields to support future multi-user setups and audit logging. üí° Note: Manual entries should include a is_manual: boolean field or be flagged in notes or features_json to enable filtering in analytics and visual indicators in UI.
Each log is linked to a user via the associated task and supports multi-user expansion.

**3.1 Database Performance & Scalability**

**UUID Implementation Strategy**
- All tables use UUIDs as primary keys for distributed scalability
- Implement B-tree indexes on all foreign key columns (task_id, user_id, etc.)
- Create composite indexes for common filter combinations:
  - (user_id, status, priority) for task filtering
  - (user_id, date) for time log queries
  - (task_id, start_time) for session analysis

**JSONB Strategy**
- features_json schema:
  - nlp_metadata: Original input and parsed result
  - user_corrections: Fields manually changed after NLP parsing
  - display_preferences: UI-specific settings
  - version_history: Track field changes over time
- Create partial indexes on common JSONB queries
- Extract high-frequency query fields to dedicated columns

**Denormalization & Data Integrity**
- Use Supabase triggers to maintain denormalized fields (e.g., last_session_ended_at)
- Implement database-level constraints for data validation
- Include modified_at timestamp on all tables for change tracking
- Add version field for optimistic concurrency control

4. Non-Functional Requirements
**Offline Mode with Progressive Enhancement**
- **Phase 1: Basic Offline Viewing**
  - Cache most recent task list and "Next Up" zone
  - Store in IndexedDB with expiration policy
  - Display "offline mode" indicator

- **Phase 2: Offline Operations**
  - Implement client-side command queue in IndexedDB
  - Generate client-side UUIDs with device prefix to prevent conflicts
  - Track all changes with timestamps and version numbers
  - Allow task creation, updates, and time tracking while offline

- **Phase 3: Synchronization & Conflict Resolution**
  - Implement two-way sync on reconnection
  - Conflict resolution strategy:
    - Server wins for shared resources
    - Last-write-wins with version checks for personal tasks
    - Merge strategy for non-conflicting field updates
    - Alert user when manual resolution is needed
  - Provide sync status indicators and history

- **Phase 4: Resilient Time Tracking**
  - Use Web Workers for background timer operation
  - Persist timer state across page refreshes
  - Implement periodic state saving to survive browser crashes

Installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA)
o	When added to iOS or Android homescreen, opens full-screen without browser UI (standalone mode)
o	Includes manifest.json and service worker for installability and offline fallback (limited scope for offline viewing or caching)
‚Ä¢	Mobile responsive
‚Ä¢	Modular Bolt component design (task_form, task_list, time_controls, etc.)
‚Ä¢	Data integrity via Supabase FK constraints
‚Ä¢	TypeScript usage in Bolt for type safety
‚Ä¢	Helpers for UID generation, task parsing, timer management

**4.1 Security Implementation**

**Row-Level Security (RLS)**
- Implement Supabase RLS policies on all tables:
  - tasks: (auth.uid() = user_id) OR id IN (SELECT task_id FROM task_assignments WHERE user_id = auth.uid())
  - time_logs: auth.uid() IN (SELECT user_id FROM tasks WHERE id = time_logs.task_id)
  - event_logs: auth.uid() = user_id
  - projects: (auth.uid() = user_id) OR id IN (SELECT project_id FROM project_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid())

**Authentication & Authorization**
- Use Supabase Auth for user authentication
- Implement role-based access for future multi-user features
- Store user preferences and settings in dedicated user_settings table

**Data Privacy**
- Implement visibility controls as described in "Task Visibility Levels"
- Add audit logging for sensitive operations
- Provide data export/deletion for user data ownership

**Enhanced Time Tracking Implementation**

**Timer Architecture**
- Implement timers using Web Workers for background operation
- Store timer state in localStorage for persistence across refreshes
- Sync timer events to server when online, queue when offline
- Support multiple concurrent timers (exclusive + non-exclusive)

**Time Zone Handling**
- Store all timestamps in UTC in the database
- Track user's timezone in user_settings table
- Convert times to local timezone for display
- Handle daylight saving transitions gracefully

**Timer States & Transitions**
- Running: actively tracking time
- Paused: temporarily stopped but resumable
- Completed: finished and logged
- Abandoned: stopped without completion

**Session Boundary Detection**
- Auto-pause after configurable idle time (default: 15 minutes)
- Prompt user on return: "Continue timer?" or "Log interruption?"
- Allow manual time entry for forgotten sessions
- Support retroactive logging with validation
