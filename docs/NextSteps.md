# Next Steps for TaskMan v3

This document outlines pending work and improvements for the TaskMan v3 project, organized by area of focus.

## Immediate Priority: MVP Development Plan

- [ ] **Document the complete phased approach to MVP development**
  - Define clear milestones and success criteria for each phase
  - Map features to user stories and acceptance criteria
  - Establish technical dependencies and development sequence
  - Set timelines and resource requirements
  - Align all development with the ultimate vision for TaskMan

This documentation is essential to prevent scope creep and ensure we don't get sidetracked with features that don't directly contribute to our core objectives.

## Density-Aware UI System

### Remaining Components
- [ ] Apply density-aware styling to Form and FormGroup components
- [ ] Convert Modal and Dialog components to use density-aware spacing
- [ ] Update Menu and MenuItem components with density settings
- [ ] Enhance Table component with density-specific row heights and padding

### UI Refinements
- [ ] Add smooth transitions between density levels
- [ ] Create responsive density presets based on screen size
- [ ] Add ability to override density for specific component instances
- [ ] Ensure consistent styling across all density levels
- [ ] Improve visual hierarchy in Compact mode

### Testing
- [ ] Create visual regression tests for density changes
- [ ] Test density system with screen readers and accessibility tools
- [ ] Add tests for TaskCard with density settings
- [ ] Develop tests for complex nested components using density

### Documentation
- [ ] Create visual documentation with examples of each component at different densities
- [ ] Add migration guide for converting existing components to density-aware versions
- [ ] Document best practices for creating new density-aware components
- [ ] Create Storybook stories for all density-aware components

## General UI Component Improvements

- [ ] Create Toast notification component
- [ ] Implement Tabs component with keyboard navigation
- [ ] Build Dropdown and Select components
- [ ] Design responsive DataTable component
- [ ] Create Date and Time picker components

## Architecture Improvements

- [ ] Implement theme switching support (light/dark mode)
- [ ] Add color variants for components (primary, secondary, success, warning, etc.)
- [ ] Create animation utility system
- [ ] Develop responsive layout components (Grid, Flex containers)
- [ ] Create a component playground for testing

## Integration Priorities

- [ ] Integrate density settings with TaskDetail component
- [ ] Apply density to Dashboard layout and widgets
- [ ] Update Settings page with more density options
- [ ] Enhance TaskList filtering UI with density awareness
- [ ] Improve mobile experience with density adaptation

## Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Optimize CSS generation for density styles
- [ ] Use React.memo for density-aware components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Add bundle size analysis for density components
- [ ] Implement code splitting for density system
- [ ] Explore CSS-in-JS alternatives for better performance

## Future Considerations

- [ ] Consider custom density levels beyond the current three options
- [ ] Investigate per-component density overrides
- [ ] Research user preferences for different task types and contexts
- [ ] Explore AI recommendations for density based on user behavior
- [ ] Consider exposing density API for plugin developers

## Development Process: Structured Requirements Gathering

In software development, ambiguity is the killer. Sometimes what you think you want to build isn't what your development team will build because of complications or implementation details that weren't initially considered.

To avoid this, follow this structured interview process before starting any significant implementation:

### Pre-Implementation Interview Process

1. **Ask clarifying questions one-by-one**
   - What is the primary user problem this feature solves?
   - Who are the primary users of this feature?
   - What are the must-have vs. nice-to-have requirements?
   - What are the expected edge cases and error states?
   - Are there performance expectations or constraints?
   - How does this feature integrate with existing functionality?
   - What are the acceptance criteria for this feature?
   - Are there any specific design or UX considerations?
   - What metrics will determine if this feature is successful?

2. **Document responses and create a clear specification**
   - Identify any remaining areas of ambiguity
   - Create mockups or wireframes if applicable
   - Define the technical approach and any architecture changes
   - Agree on the scope and timeline

3. **Only begin implementation once requirements are clear**
   - Statement from stakeholder: "We're ready to implement"
   - Final review of acceptance criteria
   - Establish check-in points for progress reviews

This process helps ensure that what's built aligns with the actual needs and expectations, reducing rework and ensuring focused development efforts.
