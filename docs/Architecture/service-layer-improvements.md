# Service Layer Improvements

This document outlines the remaining architectural improvements for the service layer in TaskMan v3, focusing on making the codebase more modular, testable, and maintainable.

## Current Status

We've implemented the following improvements:

1. ✅ Created interfaces for services (IFilterSortService, etc.)
2. ✅ Created a MockFilterSortService for testing
3. ✅ Set up testing infrastructure to validate service implementations
4. ✅ Moved business logic from contexts to services

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Complete Mock Implementations for All Services

Following the pattern established with MockFilterSortService, create mock implementations for all services:

- [ ] MockTaskService
- [ ] MockAuthService
- [ ] MockUserService
- [ ] MockCategoryService
- [ ] MockSyncService
- [ ] MockNotificationService
- [ ] MockPerformanceService
- [ ] MockTimeSessionService

Each mock service should:
- Implement the corresponding service interface
- Track method calls for assertions in tests
- Allow customizing return values for testing different scenarios
- Provide a clean API for use in component and integration tests

### 2. Improve Error Handling and Logging

Current issues:
- Error handling is inconsistent across services
- Some errors are swallowed without proper logging
- Error recovery mechanisms are incomplete

Improvements needed:

- [ ] Create a central ErrorService for consistent error handling
- [ ] Implement structured error types for different categories of errors
- [ ] Add comprehensive error logging with severity levels
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms for network operations
- [ ] Add circuit breaker patterns for degraded services

Example implementation:

```typescript
// Error types
export enum ErrorSeverity {
  INFO = 'info',
  WARNING = 'warning',
  ERROR = 'error',
  CRITICAL = 'critical'
}

export interface AppError {
  code: string;
  message: string;
  severity: ErrorSeverity;
  source: string;
  timestamp: string;
  context?: Record<string, any>;
}

// Error service interface
export interface IErrorService {
  logError(error: AppError): void;
  getLastErrors(count?: number): AppError[];
  clearErrors(): void;
}
```

### 3. Service Registration Improvements

- [ ] Implement lazy initialization for services
- [ ] Add dependency injection for services that depend on other services
- [ ] Create a consistent service lifecycle management approach

Example implementation:

```typescript
// Enhanced service registry
class EnhancedServiceRegistry {
  private services: Map<string, any> = new Map();
  private factories: Map<string, () => any> = new Map();
  
  registerFactory<T>(name: string, factory: () => T): void {
    this.factories.set(name, factory);
  }
  
  getService<T>(name: string): T {
    if (this.services.has(name)) {
      return this.services.get(name) as T;
    }
    
    if (this.factories.has(name)) {
      const service = this.factories.get(name)!();
      this.services.set(name, service);
      return service as T;
    }
    
    throw new Error(`Service ${name} not registered`);
  }
}
```

### 4. Service Caching and Performance

- [ ] Implement caching strategies for expensive service operations
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for service method calls
- [ ] Create cache invalidation mechanisms for services

Example implementation:

```typescript
// Caching decorator
function cacheable(target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  const originalMethod = descriptor.value;
  const cache = new Map();
  
  descriptor.value = function(...args: any[]) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    
    if (cache.has(key)) {
      return cache.get(key);
    }
    
    const result = originalMethod.apply(this, args);
    cache.set(key, result);
    return result;
  };
  
  return descriptor;
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize mock implementations** for the most frequently used services (TaskService, AuthService)
2. **Create a standardized error handling approach** to be used across all services
3. **Update service implementations** to use the new error handling and logging
4. **Document best practices** for service implementation and testing

By completing these improvements, we'll achieve the architectural goals of making the TaskMan codebase more:
- **Scalable**: Services will be independently testable and maintainable
- **Modular**: Clear interfaces and dependency management
- **Future-proof**: Ready for new features with consistent patterns
