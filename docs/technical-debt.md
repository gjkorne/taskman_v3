_Last updated: 2025-04-17_

**This is a living document.**

## How to Use This Document
- **Reference this file** whenever you are planning, prioritizing, or discussing refactoring, maintenance, or technical debt in the project.
- **Update this document** whenever new technical debt is identified, addressed, or resolved.
- **Link to this file** in relevant pull requests, issues, or documentation to provide context for technical debt-related changes.
- **Review this file** regularly during sprint planning, code reviews, and retrospectives to keep technical debt visible and actionable.

This document tracks current areas of technical debt in the TaskMan v3 codebase. Use this as a reference for prioritizing refactoring and maintenance work.

---

## 1. Legacy and Redundant Code
- Old service implementations may still have stray references.
- Emergency settings page bypasses React context issues instead of fixing the root cause.

## 2. Context and State Management
- Provider nesting and context structure is fragile and could be simplified.
- Not all contexts follow a standardized pattern.

## 3. UI/UX Debt
- Density-aware UI is not fully implemented in all components.
- Some components have duplicated logic that could be abstracted.
- Grid view mode was temporarily removed and needs review.

## 4. Database and Data Layer
- Past schema mismatches indicate possible remaining inconsistencies.
- Migration files and actual schema may drift out of sync.

## 5. Feature Completeness and Scalability
- Role-based access control may need further refactoring as requirements grow.
- Offline support could be improved for conflict resolution and error handling.

## 6. Testing and Documentation
- Unit and integration test coverage may be incomplete after major changes.
- Documentation may lag behind recent architectural changes.

## 7. General Code Quality
- Unused imports/variables should be cleaned up regularly.
- Error handling patterns should be standardized.

---

## Top Refactoring Opportunities
- Unify and simplify context/provider structures.
- Fully implement density-aware UI patterns.
- Remove or refactor temporary solutions (like the emergency settings page) after root issues are fixed.
- Audit for legacy code and schema mismatches.
- Increase test coverage and update documentation.
